API Test Base is an open source tool for integration testing a variety of APIs. It is 100% free and suitable for Integration, ESB, Microservices and SOA testing.

Supported API types
* HTTP
* SOAP
* Relational databases (Oracle, SQL Server, H2)
* JMS (Solace)
* FTP(S)
* AMQP
* MQTT
* IBM MQ
* IBM Integration Bus (IIB)

The tool
* has GUI, saving user programming skills. Developers also have better experience using GUIed tool, as writing, reading and maintaining code are more brain power draining.
* intends to provide a platform enabling integrating testing capabilities for all types of APIs.
* provides advanced features like unlimited level folder structure for test case management, centralized and environment based endpoints management, data driven testing, HTTP stubs (mock services), etc.
* is designed for testers and developers, but in the same team/organization BAs or architects may also benefit from it. The thought here is that API test cases contain valuable business knowledge, and this knowledge should be shared and easily accessible and consumable to everyone in the team/organization.
* does not support performance testing (for now).
