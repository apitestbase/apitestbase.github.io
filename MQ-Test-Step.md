MQ test step is normally used in combination with other test steps such as SOAP, IIB, etc. to create automated test cases. However, you can also use it to manually operate on an MQ queue. (Actually, most types of test steps in Iron Test can be used to individually/manually invoke target API)

Actions available in the MQ test step: **Clear Queue, Check Queue Depth, Enqueue, Dequeue**.

## Endpoint Details
To operate on an MQ queue, some parameters are needed for Iron Test to connect to the queue manager.
