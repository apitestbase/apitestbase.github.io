## Upgrade
Download the latest API Test Base installer from the [release page](https://github.com/apitestbase/apitestbase-release/releases/tag/{{ site.atb_release_version }}).

{% tabs upgrade %}

{% tab upgrade Windows %}

Running a new version of the installer will automatically uninstall the old version and install the new version.

Your test data, settings, etc. will stay untouched, under the `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\ApiTestBase` directory.

{% endtab %}

{% tab upgrade Mac OS %}
Coming soon ...
{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}
