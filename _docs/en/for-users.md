#### Tool is not all
Test automation is an advanced skill. 

It takes a lot of effort to learn how to plan the automation, isolate the API under test and how to use tool to develop, run, share and maintain test cases. It also takes long time to accumulate great amount of knowledge and patterns. 

But you don't have to gain the complete skill in one month (maybe it never completes). Every bit of automation experience you gain will benefit your work immediately and keep benefiting you throughout the rest of your career. 

So start automating something now!
