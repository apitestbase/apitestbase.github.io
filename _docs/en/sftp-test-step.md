SFTP test step is normally used in combination with other test steps to create automated test cases. However, you can also use it to manually do SFTP operations like uploading a file.

Actions available in the SFTP test step: **Put**.

## Put Action
You can upload file from text or from file. The action transfers file to the SFTP server.

### Target File Path
To create a remote file under specified path, enter '/path/to/the/filename'. Ensure the directory exists on the SFTP server, otherwise you could see error.
